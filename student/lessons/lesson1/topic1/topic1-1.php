            <p>A <strong>CIRCLE</strong> is an important shape in the field of geometry. Let's look at the definition of a circle and its parts. We will also examine the relationship between the circle and the plane.</p><br>
            <p>A circle is a shape with all points the same distance from its center. A circle is named by its center. Thus, the circle to the right is called circle A since its center is at point A. Some real world examples of a circle are a wheel, a dinner plate and (the surface of) a coin.</p><br>
            <p>The distance across a circle through the center is called the <strong>DIAMETER</strong>. A real-world example of diameter is a 9-inch plate.</p><br>
            <p>The <strong>RADIUS</strong> of a circle is the distance from the center of a circle to any point on the circle. If you place two radii end-to-end in a circle, you would have the same length as one diameter. Thus, the diameter of a circle is twice as long as the radius. </p><br>
            <p>A <strong>CHORD</strong> is a line segment that joins two points on a curve. In geometry, a chord is often used to describe a line segment joining two endpoints that lie on a circle. The circle to the right contains chord AB. If this circle was a pizza pie, you could cut off a piece of pizza along chord AB. By cutting along chord AB, you are cutting off a segment of pizza that includes this chord.</p><br>
